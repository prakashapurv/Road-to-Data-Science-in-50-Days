    "A lot of people skip the statistics part and directly jump to the modelling/ ML considering statistics to be tough. I was no different when i started my career as a Data Analyst. But being in a Market Research company, helped me understand the process of how important it is to understand the data (which is also a very crucial skill in Data Science) and learn to describe the data using the statistical techniques before going in to the modelling.. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 types of Statistics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Descriptive** - What are the characteristics of the data?\n",
    "2. **Inferential / Predictive** - What are the characteristics of the population? / Can we predict something given we have something?\n",

An example would be the height of a person, which you can describe by using intervals on the real number line. It can be further classified into: </li>\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2. Qualitative (Categorical):\n",
    "<br>\n",

    "<li> <b>Cluster Sampling</b>: Cluster sampling is a variation of simple random sampling. It is used when the population of the study is infinite and the population units are scattered across the wide geographical area. </li>\n",

    "\n",
    "As you might already know, India has more than 50% of its population below the age of 25 and more than 65% below the age of 35. If you’ll plot the distribution of the age of the population of India, you will find that there is a hump on the left side of distribution and the right side is comparatively planar. In other words, we can say that there’s a skew towards the end, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "So even if you haven’t read up on skewness as a data science or analytics professional, you have definitely interacted with the concept on an informal note. And it’s actually a pretty easy topic in statistics – and yet a lot of folks skim through it in their haste of learning other seemingly complex data science concepts. To me, that’s a mistake.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Skewness?\n",
    "\n",
    "Skewness is the measure of the asymmetry of an ideally symmetric probability distribution and is given by the third standardized moment. If that sounds way too complex, don’t worry! Let me break it down for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple words, skewness is the measure of how much the probability distribution of a random variable deviates from the normal distribution. Now, you might be thinking – why am I talking about normal distribution here?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, the normal distribution is the probability distribution without any skewness. You can look at the image below which shows symmetrical distribution that’s basically a normal distribution and you can see that it is symmetrical on both sides of the dashed line. Apart from this, there are two types of skewness:\n",
