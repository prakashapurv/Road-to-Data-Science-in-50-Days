    "### What is Data Science ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Science is considered as the **Sexiest job of 21st century**. There has been a lot of buzz around the word \"Data Science\" , but before we get our hands dirty digging deep into data science, i want you to take a moment to think and ask yourself, what do you think is data science ?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are lots of definition for Data Science and i am not here to define it, google is the better place to find the definition. \n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, Data Science is not a software engineering or modelling piece of work or model. Data science is not a visualization piece of work as well. Creating the cool visual is neither the end goal nor the beginning part of how a data scientist works. Needless to say, data science is not about creating visually impactful infographics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although these are important aspects of Data Science, but **Data Science is more about data and asking the right questions around your data and business problem.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Effective data scientists are able to identify relevant questions, collect data from a multitude of different data sources, organize the information, translate results into solutions, and communicate their findings in a way that positively affects business decisions. These skills are required in almost all industries, causing skilled data scientists to be increasingly valuable to companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data scientists need to be curious and result-oriented, with exceptional industry-specific knowledge and communication skills that allow them to explain highly technical results to their non-technical counterparts."

    "### The Data Science Life Cycle\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ac/50/2f/ac502f1a535531c6e081893d00585e99.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, when we talk about data science projects, nobody seems to be able to come up with a solid explanation of how the entire process goes. The typical lifecycle of a data science project involves jumping back and forth among various interdependent science tasks using variety of tools, techniques (mostly statistical methods and formulae), programming etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try to breakdown the framework in pieces:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify the Problem (Business Understanding)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The first and foremost step in the data science lifecycle requires business understanding to identify the problem. \n",
    "A mentioned earlier, a data scientist needs to be curious and keep asking questions about what is the problem that you are trying to solve?, what is will be the impact of the solution ? and many more...\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Identify the data sources available**\n",
    "\n",
    "After stating the business problem, We obtain the data that we need from available data sources.In this step, you will need to query databases, using technical skills like MySQL to process the data. The different type of databases you may encounter are like PostgreSQL, Oracle, or even non-relational databases (NoSQL) like MongoDB. Another way to obtain data is to scrape from the websites using web scraping tools such as Beautiful Soup.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another popular option to gather data is connecting to Web APIs. Websites such as Facebook and Twitter allows users to connect to their web servers and access their data. All you need to do is to use their Web API to crawl their data. And of course, the most traditional way of obtaining data is directly from files, such as downloading it from Kaggle or existing corporate data\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Identify if additional data is required**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the data is collected, we need to re-evaluate and ask ourselves\n",
    "Do we have enough data? \n",
    "Is the data sufficient to solve the business problem?\n",
    "Does the data represents the population (incase the data is sample data)?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a critical stage as having sufficient data is very important going forward with your analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Statistical Analysis (Data Preparation)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is for us to “clean” and to filter the data. Remember the “garbage in, garbage out” philosophy, if the data is unfiltered and irrelevant, the results of the analysis will not mean anything. Cleaning data also includes the task of extracting and replacing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once your data is ready to be used, and right before you jump into AI and Machine Learning, you will have to examine the data.\n",
    "First of all, you will need to inspect the data and its properties. Different data types like numerical data, categorical data, ordinal and nominal data etc. require different treatments.\n",
    "Then, the next step is to compute descriptive statistics to extract features and test significant variables. Testing significant variables often is done with correlation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we will utilise data visualisation to help us to identify significant patterns and trends in our data. We can gain a better picture through simple charts like line charts or bar charts to help us to understand the importance of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Implementation and Development (Modelling)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the stage where most people consider interesting. As many people call it “*where the magic happens*”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once again, before reaching this stage, bear in mind that the scrubbing and exploring stage are equally crucial to building useful models. So take your time on those stages instead of jumping right to this process.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few tasks we can perform in modelling. We can also train models to perform classification to differentiating the emails you received as “Inbox” and “Spam” using logistic regressions. We can also forecast values using linear regressions. We can also use modelling to group data to understand the logic behind those clusters. For example, we group our e-commerce customers to understand their behaviour on your website. This requires us to identify groups of data points with clustering algorithms like k-means or hierarchical clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "*\"In short, we use regression and predictions for forecasting future values, and classification to identify, and clustering to group values.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Communicate Results**\n",
    "\n",
    "We are at the final and most crucial step of a data science project, interpreting models and data. The predictive power of a model lies in its ability to generalise. How do we explain a model depends on its ability to generalise unseen future data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpreting data refers to the presentation of your data to a non-technical layman. We deliver the results in to answer the business questions we asked when we first started the project, together with the actionable insights that we found through the data science process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Actionable insight is a key outcome that we show how data science can bring about predictive analytics and later on prescriptive analytics. On top of that, you will need to visualise your findings accordingly, keeping it driven by your business questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Deployment and Maintenance**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the model is evaluated to solve the business problem and meets the business requirements. The model is then deployed on a server. The model can be deployed either at your local machine or on a web server such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Heroku, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "This step involves developing a plan for monitoring and maintaining the data science project in the long run. The model performance is monitored and performance downgrade is clearly monitored in this phase. Data scientists can archive their learnings from a specific data science projects for shared learning and to speed up similar data science projects in near future.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Although modelling is the most interesting part of the data science project, most of the data scientist spend 60-70% of their time in data collection and data preparation stage.\n"
